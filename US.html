                Hello babyyy, remember these pictures? These 2 were pictures of us when we were still friends.
                Our friendship before was the cause of what we have today, from simple hangouts and enjoyment,
                we are now together looking back at this part of our past. I'm very glad that I got to meet someone
                wonderful as you. With you, even though we were just friends before, my life got brighter and more alive
                because of you. I have no regrets of meeting you because I feel like the moment I met you and got close
                to you, it was a sign from God that you are the person He wants me to be with for the rest of my life.
                I'm so thankful for meeting youuuu babyyy. I LOVE YOUUUU SOO MUCHHH 💖

                Remember when it was your 18th birthday? April 23, 2025 the day that I confessed my love
                for you by using a letter and a banana cake hihi. I was really nervous and afraid of what you'll think of me 
                a friend falling in-love with you. I was afraid of what you'll say or react and honestly I was 
                shocked that you gave me chance to show you how much I raelly like you. I'm thankful for you,
                for giving me a chance to love and take care of you. This day is very memorable, you were the first
                person I ever danced with. Every moment that day feels like a once in a lifetime moment, I honestly
                didn't want to leave because when I'm with you everything is so quiet.

                because you really wanted to and I came and watched it with you, I still remember when we did something
                while watching the movie hihi, so nvm that, after the movie we bought Shawarma and ate at that place I forgot

                I couldn't find our picture when we were at BLL the place of our first kiss, when we were on the way 
                at the event place, I was overthinking because I'm not with you and I was very worried if you're okay
                after about an hour of tranportation we finaly arrived at the place and then I immediately looke for you
                all the time I was with you, we ate together, walked together, and kissed each other HSHSHS, but before that 
                we had fun, we participated with the activities and explored the place. Night comes and the Foam Party began
                we had fun then we decided to run away from the crowd. When we finally got the chance to be alone, I grabbed you
                then kissed you. It was so magical, you were my first kiss, I still remember the taste and texture of those soft
                and pink lips when I first kissed you, up until this day your lips is still the one that I want to kiss

               but I'm so glad that she allowed me to know you and love you. Tho it's kinda sad because you didn't meet my parents
               when we had the chance, but that's okay because even tho it didn't happen I'm still glad that we were able to graduate
               and grow together. It was an ending to a chapter of our life and the beginning of our new one, a chapter dedicated for 
               the both of us.
